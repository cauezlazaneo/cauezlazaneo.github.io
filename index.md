I am a Physical Oceanographer interested in physical mechanisms responsible for the energy flux among the different scales of oceanic movements. From a broad perspective, my research focuses on oceanic turbulence and the mechanisms driving the small-scale processes. These processes are essential for transporting energy from large-scale flows (e.g., large ocean currents) to the turbulence scales, where the kinetic energy is irreversibly lost. In this way, I aim to explore how turbulence, small-scale processes, and the mechanisms that break the ocean balance contribute to the ocean energy budget and their role in the face of climate change. Climate models do not ’explicitly’ solve these aforementioned processes. One of the reasons for that is the limitation of numerical grids, which are larger than the scale of the turbulent flows. They are not even fully parameterized or, in other words, considered in such models due to a lack of our understanding of their role in the whole system, resulting in biased projected scenarios. However, recent studies aimed at the physical insight of small-scale processes and their role in the general circulation of the oceans have increasingly shown that such mechanisms are essential to obtaining more realistic scenarios. In light of current discussions, there is a pressing need for a greater understanding of such phenomena.
<!-- I'm an ocean scientist at [Universidade  de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br) (USP), in Brazil, broadly interested in small-scale physical processes in the ocean and their role in Earth's Climate System.

<!-- With financial support from [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/en), [Instituto Serrapilheira](https://serrapilheira.org/en/) and [Pró-Reitoria de Pesquisa](https://sites.usp.br/prp/), I'm bulding the Multiscale Ocean & Climate Physics Research Group (f-lab) at USP. -->

<!--Originally from São Paulo and a graduate of USP, I earned in 2018 a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu), University of California San Diego. Prior to returning to USP as faculty, in 2023, I did a postdoc at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu) (2018-2020) and spent 2.5 years as faculty at [University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu) (2020-2023).

### Opportunities

I'm always looking for motivated people to work with. Please, email me if you'd like to join my group or collaborate on a project.

I'm actively recruiting **doctoral students** with strong background in physics, math and programming. No previous experience with Oceanography or Geophysical Fluid Dynamics required. Email me if interested.
